# Connecting overview
{: #connect_ov}

You can connect command-line interfaces, IBM® or third-party applications and tools, or apps that you create to your {{site.data.keyword.dashdbshort_notm}} database. 
{: shortdesc}

## Prerequisites
{: #prereqs}

Before attempting to connect to your {{site.data.keyword.dashdbshort_notm}} database, verify that you have the prerequisites. 

- Collect database details and credentials

   To connect to your database, you need database details (such as the host name) and credentials (such as a user ID and password.) You can collect this connection information from the {{site.data.keyword.dashdbshort_notm}} web console.

- Verify that a supported driver is installed

   - If your application or tool already contains the Db2 v11.1 IBM Data Server Driver Package, then your application or tool is able to connect to your {{site.data.keyword.dashdbshort_notm}} database by using that driver.
   - Otherwise, install the Db2 driver package, which you can download from the {{site.data.keyword.dashdbshort_notm}} web console.

- Configure your environment

  - Add entries to the driver configuration file, `db2dsdriver.cfg`, for your database.
  - Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)

    Connection details, such as which port to use and the connection string, depend on whether you use SSL connections. Using SSL is strongly recommended because of the stronger security it provides.

    <!-- You can choose to connect with or without SSL. Connection details, such as which port to use and the connection string, depend on whether you use SSL connections. -->

    To use SSL connections, you need a CA certificate:
    - If you use the most recent {{site.data.keyword.dashdbshort_notm}} driver package, the certificate file is bundled with the package and used for connections.
    - If you use the IBM Data Server Driver Package, you can download the SSL certificate from the {{site.data.keyword.dashdbshort_notm}} web console.

- Confirm that ports are available

   If your network is behind a firewall, confirm that communications are permitted on port number `50000` for standard protocols or port number `50001` for SSL connections.

<!-- Before you can connect to your {{site.data.keyword.dashdbshort_notm}} database, verify that you completed downloading and installing the necessary components on the prerequisites checklist: 

- [Prerequisites checklist](prereqs.html) -->

## Connecting to another Db2 database
{: #fed}

Db2 data virtualization (also known as federation) is supported by {{site.data.keyword.dashdbshort_notm}}. Data virtualization gives you single-query access to all of your data that is on multiple distributed databases anywhere in your organization. You can access data that is on any of your Db2 or Informix data sources, both in the cloud and on premises. 

This function is supported on all versions of {{site.data.keyword.dashdbshort_notm}}.
