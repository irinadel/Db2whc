It delivers a highly optimized columnar data store, actionable compression, and in-memory processing to supercharge your analytics and machine learning workloads.
{: shortdesc}

## Key features 
{: #key_features}

### Blazingly-fast engine

{{site.data.keyword.dashdbshort_notm}} is a column-organized, in-memory data warehouse designed for complex analytics and extreme concurrency. {{site.data.keyword.dashdbshort_notm}} delivers high performance on complex analytics workloads by using IBM BLU Acceleration, a collection of technologies pioneered by IBM Research that features the following key optimizations: 
- A columnar organized storage model 
- In-memory processing 
- Querying of compressed data sets
- Data skipping

### Scalable and elastic cloud service

{{site.data.keyword.dashdbshort_notm}} is an elastic service, and allows you to independently scale compute and storage through an intuitive UI or REST API.

### Native object storage support 

{{site.data.keyword.dashdbshort_notm}} on Amazon Web Services (AWS) introduces native object storage support to Db2. This functionality allows you to store traditional Db2 column-organized tables in Db2's native format on object storage while maintaining the existing SQL support and performance using a tiered storage architecture. Moving data from higher cost block storage to lower cost object storage can significantly reduce your costs and does not require changes to your workload. This feature is available on the current generation of AWS plans. For more information, see [Native Cloud Object Storage support](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/db2woc?topic=native-cloud-object-storage-support){: external}

### Open data format table support 

{{site.data.keyword.dashdbshort_notm}} on AWS introduces new DATALAKE table support. This functionality provides Db2 users with the ability to access data that is stored on inexpensive, scalable, and reliable object storage in open data formats such as PARQUET and ORC from within the Db2 Warehouse. This feature is available on the current generation of AWS plans. For more information, see [Open data format table support](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Db2whc?topic=Db2whc-open-data-format-table-support) {: external}

### Replication Support

{{site.data.keyword.dashdbshort_notm}} with Q Replication enables high-speed data replication for business continuity. This feature allows you to manage downtime with continuous availability (99.999%) and in-place recovery within a cluster. The cloud-native architecture of Db2 features multiple layers of resiliency with managed computation, highly available storage, and cross-cloud replication.  

### Expertly managed and highly secure

Day-to-day operations for {{site.data.keyword.dashdbshort_notm}}, including database monitoring, uptime checks and failovers, are fully automated. Operations are supplemented by a DevOps team that are on call to handle unexpected system failures. Data is encrypted at rest and in motion by default. Administrators can also restrict access to sensitive data through data masking, row permissions, and role-based security, and can utilize database audit utilities to maintain audit trails for their data warehouse.

### Highly resilient and reliable

{{site.data.keyword.dashdbshort_notm}} provides double protection for your data with built-in snapshot backups and geo-replicated disaster recovery backups.

### Compatible with on-premises data warehouses​

{{site.data.keyword.dashdbshort_notm}} can be configured with Oracle compatibility, so applications that were written for an Oracle database can run against {{site.data.keyword.dashdbshort_notm}} without having to be rewritten. {{site.data.keyword.dashdbshort_notm}} also comes with nearly 100% DDL, DML, and stored procedure compatibility with IBM Netezza®.

### Built-in machine learning and geospatial capabilities​

Train and run machine learning models directly in the {{site.data.keyword.dashdbshort_notm}} engine, using SQL, Python, or R. {{site.data.keyword.dashdbshort_notm}} also supports spatial analytics with Esri compatibility, including Esri data types such as GML, and integration with Jupyter Notebooks.
