# Changing your Db2 Warehouse entitlements to a Cloud Pak for Data SaaS Subscription
{: #mig_standalone}

Migrating your stand-alone parts to a Cloud Pak for Data subscription gives you more flexibility to choose which offerings you want to consume, and how much you want to consume. 

{: shortdesc}

A subscription allows you to buy credits that you can use as quickly or slowly as you want to, based on your changing needs.  If you want to provision a new instance or scale up storage or compute for an existing instance, you can initiate the request within minutes, without the need for a charge agreement to be created or amended. A subscription also provides you with the opportunity to explore a larger portfolio of offerings.


#### Steps
{: #migrate_prereq41}

1) Purchase an IBM Cloud Pak for Data as-a-Service subscription.

2) Apply this subscription to the IBM Cloud account that currently contains your Db2 Warehouse on Cloud instance.

3) Create a case with support (https://cloud.ibm.com/unifiedsupport/supportcenter) and request to have your instance converted to use this subscription.
