# Migrating your system to Db2 Warehouse Next Generation
{: #migr_gen2_gen3}

In order to migrate existing systems to the next generation (Gen 3) of {{site.data.keyword.dashdblong}}, a self-service migration tool has been provided and {{site.data.keyword.dashdbshort_notm}} users on {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Cloud will be invited individually to start using the tool. Migrating to the next generation of {{site.data.keyword.dashdbshort_notm}}, unlocks opportunities to use {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Object Storage (COS) to store database data while increasing performance of your system and saving on storage costs. It also unlocks the use of open data formats such as DATALAKE tables, allowing for seamless access to other data within your enterprise for integrated workloads.

## Accessing the Migration Tool
{: #access_migr_tool}

1. Log in to IBM Cloud and navigate to the {{site.data.keyword.dashdbshort_notm}} instance you wish to upgrade by going to Resource List > Databases > Service Details > Manage.
2. Locate the “System upgrade available: Upgrade to the newest version of {{site.data.keyword.dashdbshort_notm}}”, then click Learn More to begin the upgrade process.


## Step 1: Create a New Instance
{: #migr_create_instance}

A duplicate of the current (Gen 2) IBM Cloud Classic {{site.data.keyword.dashdbshort_notm}} instance will be provisioned on the new Gen 3 infrastructure, with an estimated provisioning time displayed. All instance specifications, including compute and storage resources, will be seamlessly transitioned from the IBM Cloud Classic infrastructure to the Gen 3 environment. Once provisioning is complete, the new instance name will appear, and you can launch into the instance. At this stage, the instance will not contain any data until Step 2 is completed.

## Step 2: Restore and Test Your New System 
{: #migr_restore}

You can choose an existing backup or create a new backup from the prior instance to restore onto the newly provisioned instance, bringing in all data. During the restore process, the estimated restore time will be displayed. At this time, you can point your applications to the new server instance to verify that your existing applications and workloads are functioning as expected. This step allows you to perform validation checks before triggering the final upgrade (Step 3). All identity and access management configurations will also be transferred. This step can be repeated as needed to sync data from the old instance to the new one.

## Step 3: Final Upgrade
{: #migr_upgrade}

This step completes the upgrade process. A full backup of the database from the prior system will be taken and restored onto the new Gen 3 system. Both the hostname from the previous system and the new hostname for the Gen 3 instance will remain active, ensuring that applications, including those inserting and querying data, are routed to the upgraded Gen 3 environment. However, any private connections will need to be explicitly updated to point to the new instance, as described in more detail in the FAQ section.
The prior system will still exist but will no longer be accessible for connections, effectively rendering it offline. Billing for both systems will continue unless the old system is deleted. At this stage, billing for the new system will begin.

## Step 4: Delete Your Old System
{: #migr_delete}

Once the final upgrade in Step 3 is completed and the new instance is in use, you can delete the old {{site.data.keyword.dashdbshort_notm}} instance. To do this, go to the actions dropdown on the manage page. Deleting the old system ensures that you avoid unnecessary charges and maintenance of outdated resources.
