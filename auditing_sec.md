# Auditing for Db2 Warehouse on Cloud

{{site.data.keyword.at_full_notm}} allows you to forward the Db2 diagnostic log (db2diag.log) from your {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} instances to your own Log Analysis with LogDNA service instance. Choosing to enable log forwarding allows you to use Log Analysis to retain these logs for the time period required by your organization, or to search or analyze the logs.

As a security officer, auditor, or manager, you can use the {{site.data.keyword.at_full}} service to track how users and applications interact with the Db2 Warehouse on Cloud service in {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}. {: shortdesc}

{{site.data.keyword.at_full_notm}} records user-initiated activities that change the state of a service in {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}. You can use this service to investigate abnormal activity and critical actions and to comply with regulatory audit requirements. In addition, you can be alerted about actions as they happen. The events that are collected comply with the Cloud Auditing Data Federation (CADF) standard. For more information, see the getting started tutorial for {{site.data.keyword.at_full_notm}}.

Activity Tracker with LogDNA integration is available for {{site.data.keyword.dashdblong}} deployments in the regions according to the following table: 

| Deployment region | Activity Tracker region |
|----------|-----------|
| Dallas | us-south |
| Washington | us-east |
| Frankfurt | eu-de |
| London | eu-gb | 
| Sydney | au-syd |
| Tokyo | jp-tok |
| Toronto | ca-tor |

## Activity Tracker with LogDNA provisioning
{: #at_log_analysis}

After you provision the service, events are automatically forwarded from all of your {{site.data.keyword.dashdblong}} deployments in the same region.

The service can be provisioned from its [catalog page](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog/services/logdnaat?callback=%2Fobserve%2Factivitytracker%2Fcreate){: external} or from an existing [Observability Dashboard](https://cloud.ibm.com/observe/activitytracker){: external}.

The Activity Tracker with LogDNA service has a Lite plan that is free to use, but it only offers streaming events. To take advantage of the tagging, export, retention, and other features, you need to use one of the [paid plans](/docs/activity-tracker?topic=activity-tracker-service_plan).


## Event fields
{: #at_ev_fields}

A description of the common fields for an Activity Tracker event is on the [Event fields](/docs/activity-tracker?topic=activity-tracker-event) page.

## List of events
{: #at_list_ev}

The following table lists the events that get sent to Activity Tracker from {{site.data.keyword.dashdblong}} deployments:

| Action | Description |

| `<service_id>.database-connection.list`| Lists active database connections. A "-failure" flag is included in the message if the attempt to delete a user failed. |
| `<service_id>.database-connection.stop`| Terminates a database connection. A "-failure" flag is included in the message if the attempt to delete a user failed. |
| `<service_id>.lock.enable`| Locks a user account indefinitely. A "-failure" flag is included in the message if the attempt to delete a user failed. |
| `<service_id>.lock.disable`| Unlocks a user account. A "-failure" flag is included in the message if the attempt to delete a user failed. |
| `<service_id>.policy.list`| Lists available policies. A "-failure" flag is included in the message if the attempt to delete a user failed. |
| `<service_id>.policy.update`| A policy was updated. A "-failure" flag is included in the message if the attempt to delete a user failed. |
| `<service_id>.policy.delete`| A policy was deleted. "-failure" flag is included in the message if the attempt to delete a user failed. |
| `<service_id>.schema.create`| A schema was created. A "-failure" flag is included in the message if the attempt to delete a user failed. |

The `<service_id>` field indicates the type of {{site.data.keyword.databases-for}} deployment. For example, `dashdb` or `messages-for-rabbitmq`.
## Viewing events
You can access Activity Tracker with LogDNA through the **Observability** tab of your deployment's **Manage** page. The **Manage Activity Tracker** button links to the main list of all Activity Tracker instances in your {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} account. Select the instance where you set your database logs to be forwarded. {{site.data.keyword.at_full_notm}} can have only one instance per location. Click **View Activity Tracker** to view the events.

After the event activity is forwarded to the service, each event can be expanded to a detailed view by clicking the arrow to the left of the time stamp.

The Activity Tracker with LogDNA service offers [searching](/docs/log-analysis?topic=log-analysis-view_logs#view_logs_step6), [filtering](/docs/log-analysis?topic=log-analysis-view_logs#view_logs_step5), and [export](/docs/log-analysis?topic=log-analysis-export#export) of events so you can customize retention for your use case. You can also use it to configure [alerts](/docs/log-analysis?topic=log-analysis-alerts).

## Database Auditing using Db2 Audit Facility 

You can monitor data access in your {{site.data.keyword.dashdblong}} instance with the built-in Db2 audit facility. This features provides database-level auditing in addition to the audit capability described earlier. Use the Db2 audit facility to generate and maintain an audit trail for a series of predefined database events, including attempts to access or manipulate database objects, user authentication, SQL statement execution, and even access to the audit log. Use the audit log to reveal usage patterns that would identify system misuse, and in turn, take action to eliminate such misuse.
{: shortdesc}

It is highly recommended that your COS bucket is configured in the same region and platform (IBM Cloud Object Storage or AWS S3) as your Db2WoC instance. {: Attention}

Before initial configuration, you must collect the following information:

**Note:** It is highly recommended that your COS bucket is configured in the same region and platform (IBM Cloud Object Storage or AWS S3) as your Db2WoC instance.

## Cloud Object Storage credentials

*IBM COS*

* [IBM Cloud Object Storage](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cloud-object-storage?topic=cloud-object-storage-uhc-hmac-credentials-main)
* The endpoint can be collected upon initial configuration or in the instance detail. See available [endpoints](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cloud-object-storage?topic=cloud-object-storage-endpoints). 


Example, 

    cos_hmac_keys:
      access_key_id:      7exampledonotusea6440da12685eee02
      secret_access_key:  8not8ed850cddbece407exampledonotuse43r2d2586


*AWS S3*

* [Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/security-creds.html)
* The endpoint can be collected upon initial configuration or in the instance detail. See available [endpoints](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html).


Example,

		access key ID: AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE
		secret access key: wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY

## Cloud Object Storage bucket name

You must create a bucket that will store the audit records. You will need to save the bucket name during initial configuration. It is recommended that you do not use this bucket for other purposes. Consider securely configuring the bucket with appropriate encryption, access management, and data retention.

For cost control measures, you should set a quota to the [relevant bucket](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cloud-object-storage?topic=cloud-object-storage-quota) and set an [expiration rule](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cloud-object-storage?topic=cloud-object-storage-expiry).

Once the audit records have been successfully uploaded to the cloud object storage bucket, you can preview the files in the Console. To review larger subsets of the audit logs, refer to [Audit Policy](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/db2woc?topic=features-audit-policy-guidelines). The [format](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/db2/11.5?topic=format-example-del-file) of the archived audit logs is DEL which separates the text with commas. You can reformat and process this file in your system for further analysis.

## Enable auditing 

To enable database auditing, open the web console, select Administration, and navigate to the Audit tab. Click on Enable Audit button. After configuration, complete set up by defining and activating at least one policy.

You may create a new remote storage alias or use an existing one. It is recommended that you configure a dedicated COS bucket for auditing. To ensure the audit logs are written to your COS bucket, leave Object Path blank. It is sufficient to only provide the COS bucket since the audit facility autogenerates the object name upon write.
